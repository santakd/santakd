## 👋 Hey there, I'm @santakd — Welcome to my corner of the internet! 🚀

🧠 I'm a **builder of resilient systems**, a life long student of **clean architecture**, and a practitioner of **production-first engineering**. I thrive at the intersection of **performance**, **scalability**, and **observability**, and I love crafting tools that make systems smarter, teams faster, and nights on-call quieter. 😎

---

### 🛠️ What I Love Building:
- ⚙️ **Blazing-fast backends** — built with a purpose, profiled with intent.
- 🔍 **Observability toolchains** — metrics, traces, logs, and dashboards that make noise obvious and silence safe.
- 🧱 **Scalable microservices** — designed for failure, built for scale.
- 🔐 **Secure-by-default architectures** — where dev and prod play nice.

---

### 🌱 Currently Dabbing In:
- 🐍 **Python** — automating ops, building tools, and scripting all the things.
- 🦀 **Rust** — for when performance and memory safety must shake hands.
  
---

### 💬 Engineering Vibes:
- 🧭 **Design for operability.**
- 🔁 **Think idempotent.**
- 📊 **Logs are the breadcrumbs of truth.**
- 🧪 **Metrics predict the future.**
- 🔥 **Traces tell the story.**
- 🧯 **Incidents are the sharpest retros.**
- 🤝 **Resilience is not a feature, it's a responsibility.**

---

### 🤝 Looking to Collaborate On:
- 🛠️ Dev tools that help engineers **ship, monitor, and sleep better**.
- 📈 Observability frameworks, alerting pipelines, and trace visualizers.
- 🧰 Reliability tooling: chaos testing, synthetic checks, auto-remediation.

### ✨ Fun Facts:
- I treat **latency budgets** like financial budgets — every millisecond counts.
- My favorite metric unit is **requests per second per engineer per coffee** ☕
- I believe in the philosophy: **“If you can’t measure it, you can’t trust it.”**
- Sometimes I write InfluxQL and PromQL just for fun. Don’t judge me. 😄
- LEGOs fascinate me, the more complex the set, the more fun they are.
- I collect **Hot Wheels and Dinky cars** — because performance isn’t just for services, it's for die-cast too. 🏎️🔥

🖖 Cheers and keep your services fast, observable, and boring in all the right ways.
